# Meal-Planner
## Overview
Managing the diet for an individual with learning difficulties can be challenging, especially working out suitable choices that they like, ensuring the choices are part of a balanced diet and conveying what a balanced diet looks like effectively to the individual non verbally. This type of exercise also has the aim to empower the individual to choose their own meals and encourage independent but informed decision making. Currently this is done using a paper based approach and presents issues.

You will need a large collection of laminated paper food symbols that keep up with the ever changing items in the cupboards. It’s also inconvenient using real items as that means the individual is routing through cupboards, which can be a safety risk, leave a mess and not suitable with certain items out of reach. 

We therefore would like to develop a meal planner app which provides individuals with learning disabilities a means of choosing their own meals and educate them on healthy balanced choices when doing so. And for carers / families it will mean they can manage this seamlessly for the first time without the need to print, laminate etc or entertain other practices. 
Once built, it will be primarily tested on our client, but will be available for free to all families and organisations across the UK to use too. It’s purposely kept simple so that anyone can pick up and manage it and / adds in their own symbols to the library.
